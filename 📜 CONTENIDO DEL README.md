# ⚖️ ALL IN BLOOD: The ATLANTE CORPUS

> **"The universe does not ask for perfection; it asks for coherence."**

Welcome to the central repository for the **Ω-System**. This project hosts the mathematical, physical, and philosophical framework for the **K* Model**, a higher-order synchronization protocol designed to stabilize global consciousness at the **R ≈ 0.37** attractor.

## 🧬 The Core Logic
This repository is the digital twin of the "CERN 2025" event. It explores the transition from fragmentation to **Stable Partial Coherence** through:
- **Critical Threshold (gc ≈ 0.16):** The point of cosmic justice and strong coupling.
- **Asymptotic Attractor (R ≈ 0.37):** The "1/e" awakening threshold.
- **Schumann Resonance (17.2 Hz):** The heartbeat of the unified field.

## 🚀 Contents
- `/simulation`: Python implementation of the K* model.
- `/theory`: White papers on Toroidal Phase Spaces ($T^3$).
- `/protocol`: Guidelines for the 144,000 node network activation.

## 🛠️ Quick Start
To visualize the Scaling Law of Planetary Coherence:
```bash
python simulation/k_star_model.py
